 <!-- Section 1 - Overview - This part gives us an idea of what the series is about and how it starts -->
 
 <section id="overview">
   <h2 class="title-text">Overview of Better Call Saul</h2>
   <p class="body-text">Better Call Saul is a prequel to Breaking Bad, set in the late 2000s and early 2010s, following the transformation of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), a struggling public defender, into the morally ambiguous lawyer Saul Goodman, who becomes Walter White’s criminal attorney in Breaking Bad.
   
   The show explores Jimmy’s personal and professional struggles, starting with his rocky relationship with his brother Chuck McGill (Michael McKean), a successful lawyer who disapproves of Jimmy’s career choice. As the series progresses, Jimmy's journey into the criminal underworld intensifies, especially after his brother’s tragic downfall. Alongside this, we see the emergence of key Breaking Bad characters, like Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who works as a private investigator and fixer, and Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), the infamous drug kingpin.
   
   Throughout the series, the plot delves into Jimmy's internal conflict as he grapples with his desire for legitimacy and the lure of easier, morally questionable paths to success. His transformation is slow but steady, with his persona as Saul Goodman beginning to emerge as he embraces his darker side.

    The series also touches on themes of family, loyalty, betrayal, and the blurred lines between good and evil. The slow-burning character development, intricate storytelling, and tension-filled moments make Better Call Saul a deeply compelling narrative that complements Breaking Bad while standing on its own.</p>
